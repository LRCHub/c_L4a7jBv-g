You'd love this bar I stumbled on
They play George Strait and they pour their doubles strong
I've been gone for two weeks now
There's some missing you in every little town
Ain't sure what I thought I'd find riding these yellow lines
Outrunnin' your memory is like outrunnin' the wind
I can't get where I'm going if I can't leave where you've been
I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky
I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night
The longer gone I get on down the road
Reminds me, baby, that there just ain't no
Outrunnin' your memory
I'm by myself but I'm not alone
'Cause you've been right here in this truck since San Antone
I bet you'll still be by my side
If I don't break down 'fore I make them LA lights
Been a thousand miles headed west and it's like I never left
Outrunnin' your memory is like outrunnin' the wind
I can't get where I'm going if I can't leave where you've been
I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky
I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night
The longer gone I get on down the road
Reminds me, baby, that there just ain't no
Outrunnin' your memory
I ain't sure what I thought I'd find riding these yellow lines
Outrunnin' your memory (mm)
Outrunnin' your memory
I see you in every sunset, every star in the sky
I hear you callin' my name in the middle of the night
The longer gone I get on down the road (mm)
Reminds me, baby, that there just ain't no (that there just ain't no)
Outrunnin' your memory (outrunnin' your memory)
Outrunnin' your memory (outrunnin' your memory)
Outrunnin' your memory (outrunnin' your memory, outrunnin' your memory)
