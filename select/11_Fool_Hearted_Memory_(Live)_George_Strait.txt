Nickles and dimes
Memories and wine
She's on his mind once again
The same old stool
The same old fool
Played by the rules but didn't win

There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
He'd try forgettin' but he knows that it's no use

He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more

She was his girl
His only world
That string of pearls that slipped away
A thousand dimes
A thousand times
He doesn't mind what they say
He fills the jukebox then plays the same old song
He fills his glass and then he turns her memory on

But it's a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more

He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more
